# Lesk
This algorithm is a modified implementation of the Adapted Lesk algorithm, which uses a knowledge-based, overlapping-based approach to accomplish the task of Word Sense Diasmbiguation. 

This algorithm achieves a better run-time complexity than the original Adapted Lesk, but is not quite as accurate.
