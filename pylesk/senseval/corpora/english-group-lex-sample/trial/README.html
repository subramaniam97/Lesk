    <h1>SENSEVAL-2 English trial data</h1>

English lexical-sample data will comply with SENSEVAL XML
specifications, and the sample downloadable at
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cotton/senseval/fmts/lexical-sample-english-xml
(also enclosed in this bundle) is a sample of what the contexts will
look like.

<p>
<h2>Corpus sources</h2>

That sample on the website (as at today, 13 Feb 2001) is drawn from the HECTOR
corpus; actual SENSEVAL-2 data will be drawn from BNC-2, LDC's North
American News Corpus, and with a small sample taken from arbitrary web
pages, to test the extent to which algorithms are tied to particular
text types.  Samples drawn from these sources, using the same methods
that will be used for the training and test materials, will be
available for download to registered participants from the SENSEVAL
website by 1st March.

<h2>Lexicon</h2>

The lexicon to be used will be a new version of WordNet, with
provisional name WN 1.6.s.  This has a number of errors corrected and
other improvements since WN 1.6.; in particular, all entries for items
in the English lexical sample have been checked with a view to
clarifying sense distinctions and merging senses which are
insuffiently distinct from each other.  In terms of format etc it will
be as WN 1.6, so it is appropriate to set up systems to operate with
WN 1.6.


<p> All being well, WN 1.6.s will be on public release before the
critical dates for SENSEVAL-2 (eg 17 April 2001).  We shall keep you
posted on this via the senseval-discuss mailing list.  

<p> Our thanks
to George Miller, Randee Tengi and Christiane Fellbaum at Princeton
for their co-operation and support in the preparation of WN 1.6.s.
