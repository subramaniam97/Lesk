The lexical sample tasks senseval is a word sense disambiguation task
for particular (preselected) lexical items.

Answers to a lexical sample task may be provided as a table of 
INSTANCEID, SENSEID pairs, where INSTANCEID refers to the value
of each "id" attribute of each "instance" element in documents 
conforming to this dtd.  Additionally, answers may be embedded 
in this document in order to distribute "gold standard" corpora or 
to facilitate software processing of all the relevant data.

<!-- a corpus is divided up by lexical item and is associated
     with a language (should maybe use isoXXX character set encodings) -->
