LEXICON Format
--------------
The format of data in lexicon could be described by following pseudo-regular expression.

<form>given_word_form<lemma>lemma_1(<lemma>lemma[1..N])*

Relevant senses of every possible word form can be retrieved by the simple look-up of the line with given form in lexicon.

SENSE Map
---------
Sense map between given senseid and referenced lemma in the lexicon (sense) is the identity. There is needed no transformation.

senseid = lemma
