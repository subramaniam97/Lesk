The entranceway was flanked by high banks protruding outwards from the main rampart and strengthened by a <head>wooden</head> palisade.

The right exists because the very same interest on which the power to promise and the duty to keep promises are based is also the ground for holding others to be subject to a duty not to interfere with one&apos;s promising. 
The duty requires one not to prevent a person from promising (e.g. by denying him the means of communicating an intention to undertake by that very communication an obligation, or by stopping others from receiving such communications). 
It also requires one not to force people to <head>promise</head> nor to induce them improperly to promise or not to promise.

Over the past year its image has been brilliantly promoted by a series of black and white print and billboard ads in which good-looking arty and sporty achievers are photographed by Herb Ritts, Matthew Rolston and Steven Meisel. 
Hollywood starlets and aspiring beefcake, fashion editors, film-makers and boxers have been shown alongside Miles Davis, Verushka, Kim Basinger and the American elder statesman of fashion design, Geoffrey Beene, all wearing Gap clothes their way. 
That the company has persuaded cult figures to promote the humble Gap pocketed <head>T-shirt</head>, which sells at #8, is an achievement in itself, but despite being showered with advertising awards and press attention, Mickey Drexler, The Gap&apos;s president, has a policy of dodging personal publicity and making sure his executives keep their names out of the papers.

The same cannot be said of Tour de France 1990 (C4), which spoils a lot of nice views of French countryside by intruding an unaesthetic snake of bicyclists into the picture at all times, but the coverage included an interesting item about the Caravan Publicitaire, a procession of cars and vans and novelty vehicles which covers the route ahead of the racers and distributes plastic carrier bags and similar tat to the over-excited populace and derives much publicity and goodwill for the commercial sponsors. 
The balance is clearly a delicate one; too far ahead of the race and the masses have not gathered in sufficient numbers, too close and they aren&apos;t interested in your tawdry largesse at all, and of course you must never never get in the way of the cyclists, but the cars disguised as Kicker boots or cream cakes were certainly good for a giggle.

After I had cut down my time at work to two days a week and had really bonded with the Bug, I grew bold one afternoon, stunned at the perfect love-inspiring beauty of her round glowing face as she lay on the changing table studying a small superball she held in her hands, after I had wiped her captivating little coffee bean of a pudendum and put on a new diaper, the air filled with the fresh sound of crinkly plastic as she kicked experimentally, and after I had rolled up the old gel-puffed diaper into a tight hoagie and secured it with its own adhesive tabs: I bent low toward her face, filling her vision with a pretend-amazed expression, and deliberately tasted, or rather touched my tongue tip to the perimeter of, one of her nostril openings. 
She pushed me away uninterestedly, staring in complete concentration at the swirling blue and red injections in the amber-colored superball (originally a stocking-stuffer from me to Patty, but like many of the toys we had once given to each other, now finding a secondary life as a Bug-diversion), but for me the sensation marked a new stage of love for her, as when a cat touches your hand with its nose and jumps back at the static and yet is willing to try to sniff you again, or when one time in college Patty got out of my dorm bed with only a dark blue <head>T-shirt</head> on and discovered a dime stuck to her bottom, because we had been sleeping all night in change that had poured at some stage of arousal from my pants pockets the night before, and said sleepily, without puzzlement, `Dime on my bottom,&quot; and put it on my desk, and I had used it as a bookmark for several years after that, erasing a stripe in it to single it out.

Decorating Easter eggs became a popular occupation. 
British eggs have not, on the whole, been as elaborately decorated as those in Europe, but they have been dyed different colours using plant dyes, for example orange and yellow eggs can be obtained by boiling them in a muslin bag with carrots, or orange or lemon peel or onion skins, using a small amount of water, with spinach or dandelion used for green eggs. 
Sometimes, particularly in the north of England, eggs were imprinted with delicate flower designs, using such varieties as vetch. lupin, rose, lady&apos;s mantle and fern, which were gently placed against the egg shell and held in place by wrapping the eggs with <head>onion</head> skins or strips of fabric, the eggs becoming coloured in parts not covered by the plants as the dye was boiled out of the fabric.
