The English lexical sample task is the result a Coordinated Effort from Adam
Kilgarriff and UPenn.

Penn provided the training/testing data for the verbs in the lexical sample
English task, and the testing data for the all-words task.  The lexical
sample verbs were tagged by Lauren Delfs and Susanne Wolff, with Christiane
Fellbaum as an arbitrator.  The all words data was tagged by Lauren Delfs
and Kate Forbes, with Susanne Wolff and Christiane Fellbaum both as
arbitrators.   Lauren and Kate are both Linguistics students, and Susanne
is a consultant.  All of the taggers used a sense tagging interface
implemented by Joseph Rosenzweig and maintained by Scott Cotton.  Well over
1000 person hours went into the tagging tasks.

The all words text comes from Penn Treebank II Wall Street Journal articles.
(Copyright )  1996-2000 Linguistic Data Consortium, University of
Pennsylvania.  All rights reserved.)  The lexical sample verb tagging data
also came primarily from the Wall Street Journal data in Penn Treebank II.
However, where that did not supply enough samples to approximate
75+15*senses per verb, we supplemented with British National Corpus
instances.  We did not find sentences for every sense of every word we
tagged.  We also sometimes found sentences for which none of the available
senses were appropriate, and they are tagged with NT for Not There.

The nouns, adjectives and verbs for the lexical sample task were also
grouped at Penn, with an attempt to be explicit about the criteria for each
grouping.  These criteria
included differences in semantic classes of arguments, differences in the
number and type of arguments, whether or not something is created or there
is a shared result, whether an action is abstract vs. concrete or actual
vs. mental, whether there is a specialized subject domain, etc.  All of the
verbs were grouped by two or more people with differences being reconciled.
 The nouns and adjectives were grouped by Lauren Delfs, and since WordNet
does not have groups for nouns and adjectives were done quite independently
of WN.  The verb groupers included Scott Cotton, Lauren Delfs, Hoa Trang
Dang, Christiane Fellbaum, Martha Palmer and Susanne Wolff.  In some cases
the groupings of the verbs are identical to the original WordNet groupings,
in some cases they are quite different.  Some verbs were extremely
difficult to group, and no one was happy with the result.

These groupings or the original WN groupings are available for use as
coarse-grained senses for scoring purposes.
