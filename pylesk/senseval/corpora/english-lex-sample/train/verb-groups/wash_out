NOTES.

There are two basic categories for the senses of "wash out."  The first refers 
to the general idea of laundering something, with the difference being an 
alternation: whether the direct object is the thing that needs dirt removed 
(sense 2) or the dirt being removed (sense 4).  

The other category is somewhat more interesting and might be glossed as 
"bleach or drain of some characteristic relating to vitality.  Three senses 
have been classified here, though two of them are just syntactic alternations. 
The first sense refers to draining vitality (sense 5), and the other to refer 
to bleaching in colour; they differ in that the first takes an agent of 
bleacher and an object of bleachee (sense 6) and the second is intransitive 
with the bleachee as subject (sense 7).

Two other senses were left unclassified: the first is the interruption of some 
activity due to weather (sense 1), and the second is for the movement of an 
object by water (sense 3).
