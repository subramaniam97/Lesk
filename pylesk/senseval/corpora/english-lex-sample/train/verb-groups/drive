NOTES:

The senses of "drive" seem to fall into two categories: the senses involving 
vehicles (usually cars) and all of the others.  The non-car senses are in some 
cases more difficult to group as they overlap somewhat according to which 
criteria one uses.  I have probably not been completely consistent in my choice 
of criteria here (with the non-vehicle senses).

GROUP ONE.  The vehicle senses all belong together, if for no other reason 
beyond their sheer numbers.  Mostly they seem to differ syntactically: there is 
the act of physically operating the vehicle, with the driver as subject and the 
vehicle as object (sense 1); an intranstive usage specifying the direction or 
manner of travel (sense 2); the causative in which the subject transports a 
(usually human) direct object (sense 3); the middle construction where the 
vehicle is the subject and is modified adverbially (sense 12); an employment 
sense which may be either transitive or intransitive (sense 13); an intransitive
with the vehicle as subject (sense 14); and, finally, the driver as subject and 
path as direct object (sense 15).

GROUP TWO.  The senses in this group all refer to induced activity or 
motivation.  This may be resultative, in which the subject causes the direct 
object to move into or out of some state (sense 4), strictly motivational, where
the subject is some type of stimulus and the direct object is the experiencer 
(sense 5), or a subject compelling the direct object to perform a specific 
action, often against the will of the object (sense 7).

GROUP THREE.  This group is categorised by the physical movement of an item away
from the agent.  Some of the senses refer to general induced motion and differ 
in manner, whether the subject is directing (or herding) the movement of objects
(sense 8) or causing rapid movement without further involvement (sense 9).  
Other senses are domain-specific to golf (sense 16) or cricket (sense 17).  I 
have also included sense 6 here, somewhat questionably; sense 6 can refer to 
dispelling more abstract things (such as urges), but it can also refer to 
driving away invaders, which can be physical, and so, after some deliberation, I
have decided to include it.

GROUP FOUR.  The two senses in this group belong together because they are very 
specific to the domain of hunting.  They differ syntactically as to whether the 
object is the area searched for game (sense 20) or the game itself (sense 21).

SENSE 19.  Sense 19 refers to the powering of mechanical objects.  I have 
decided not to include it in a group because it shares features with several 
other groups: the "operate a car" senses in the first group and something of the
motivational element in the second group.  But its membership in either category
is not entirely felicitous; hence it seems to be better left alone.

OTHER SINGLETONS.  Three other senses have not been grouped.  Sense 10 refers to
a person working steadily at some task and has been excluded from the second 
group because there is no real "motivational" component.  Sense 11 is specific 
to the realm of discourse and seems to be more or less unique.  Sense 18 is 
specific to mining and could, for all I know, fit marvelously in some group or 
other; but as I know absolutely nothing about mining, I have decided that I am 
unqualified to categorise it.
