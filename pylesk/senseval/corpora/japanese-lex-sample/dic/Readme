Data Set of SENSEVAL2 Japanese Task (monolingual dictionary-based task)

* Notice

This package contains the evaluation data, training data and sense
inventory for the monolingual dictionary-based task (dictionary task
hereafter).

For evaluation and training data, we use text excerpts from 1994
Mainiti Shimbun newspaper articles. Due to copyright restrictions, you
are required to purchase the `1994 Mainiti Shimbun' CD-ROM and
individually reconstruct the evaluation and training data using tools
provided in this package. Purchase details for the Mainiti Shimbun
CD-ROM can be viewed at: 

  http://cactus.aist-nara.ac.jp/lab/resource/cdrom/Mainichi/MS.html
  (written in Japanese only)

Alternatively, e-mail Kiyoaki Shirai at kshirai@jaist.ac.jp for details.

The following data used for the dictionary task have been developed by
RWCP (Real World Computing Partnership).
  - Morphological information and the categorical codes (Universal
    Decimal Classification codes, UDC codes) for newspaper articles in
    the evaluation data
  - Annotated Japanese dictionary `Iwanami Kokugo Jiten', which is the 
    sense inventory of the dictionary task. For each sense in the
    dictionary, a corresponding sense ID and morphological information
    are supplied.
  - Morphological information, sense IDs and the UDC codes for
    newspaper articles in the training data
You also need the `RWC text database ver. 2' CD-ROM, and can obtain it
for a small charge. Purchase details for RWC text database CD-ROM can
be viewed at:

  http://www.rwcp.or.jp/wswg/rwcdb/text/index.html
  (written in Japanese only)

Alternatively, e-mail Kiyoaki Shirai at kshirai@jaist.ac.jp for details.

Note that the character coding system used in the data set is EUC, and
the character at the end of each line is LF (Line Feed).

* Permitted Uses

- The data in this package may only be used for research purpose.
- When you purchase 1994 Mainiti Shimbun CD-ROM, you may sign the
  copyright agreement form for Mainiti newspapers. If you violate the
  copyright restriction to use the CD-ROM, you lose the right to use
  the data in this package too, and should remove it from your
  organization immediately.

* Data for Dictionary Task

1. Evaluation Data

You must reconstruct the evaluation data from `jp-dic.evaluation.xml.in'
(see below). See also `jp-lexical-sample.dtd' for details of tags and
attributes used in the evaluation data.

2. Iwanami Kokugo Jiten

You must reconstruct the Iwanami Kokugo Jiten from `jp-dic.iwanami.xml.in'
(see below). See also `jp-dic-iwa.dtd' for details of tags and
attributes used in the Iwanami Kokugo Jiten.

3. Training Data

You must reconstruct the training data from `jp-dic.training.xml.in'
(see below). See also `jp-dic-train.dtd' for details of tags and
attributes used in the training data.


* Data Reconstruction

1. To reconstruct the evaluation data:

cd test/
perl recon-art.pl -e -D text97_1/ma94 -I mai -F mai94.txt > art-eval.txt
perl recon-eval.pl -D jp-dic.evaluation.xml.in -I eval.idx -a art-eval.txt -u text95_3/ma94.udc > jp-dic.evaluation.xml

Note:
  - 1994 Mainiti Shimbun CD-ROM and RWC CD-ROM are required to
    reconstruct the data. 
  - `jp-dic.evaluation.xml' is the reconstructed evaluation data. Its
    size will be 115,588,931 bytes.
  - `art-eval.txt' is the temporary file. Its size will be 10,480,584
    bytes.
  - `mai94.txt' is the file in the 1994 Mainiti Shimbun CD-ROM.
  - `text97_1/ma94' is the directory where four index files
    (mai.{idx,dif,ix1,ix2}) exist in the RWC CD-ROM.
  - `text95_3/ma94.udc' is the file in the RWC CD-ROM that consists of
    the ID number of the newspaper articles and UDC codes for those
    articles.

2. To reconstruct the evaluation data without morphological information:

cd test/
perl recon-eval.pl -D jp-dic.evaluation.xml.in -I eval.idx -A mai94.txt > jp-dic.evaluation2.xml

Note:
  - 1994 Mainiti Shimbun CD-ROM is required to reconstruct the data.
    In this case, no morphological information and UDC codes for
    newspaper articles will be reconstructed.
  - `jp-dic.evaluation2.xml' is the reconstructed evaluation data. Its
    size will be 15,488,621 bytes.
  - `mai94.txt' is the file in the 1994 Mainiti Shimbun CD-ROM.

3. To reconstruct the Iwanami Kokugo Jiten in XML format:

cd sense/
perl recon-iwa.pl -D jp-dic.iwanami.xml.in -P ../pos-code.tbl -I text96_2 > jp-dic.iwanami.xml

Note:
  - RWC CD-ROM is required to reconstruct the data.
  - `jp-dic.iwanami.xml' is the reconstructed Iwanami Kokugo
    Jiten. Its size will be 67,241,492 bytes.
  - `text96_2' is the directory where the original files of Iwanami
    Kokugo Jiten (i01 - i30) exist in the RWC CD-ROM. As there are
    some format errors in these original files, you must correct them
    with the patch `tx96_2p1.tar.gz'. This patch is available at the
    following URL:

	http://www.rwcp.or.jp/wswg/rwcdb/text/tx96_2p1.tar.gz

4. To reconstruct the training data:

cd train/
perl recon-art.pl -t -D text95_2 -I mai -F mai94.txt > art-train.txt
perl recon-train.pl -D jp-dic.training.xml.in -I train.idx -S text98_1/mai_ws.txt -a art-train.txt -u text95_3/ma94.udc > jp-dic.training.xml

Note:
  - 1994 Mainiti Shimbun CD-ROM and RWC CD-ROM are required to
    reconstruct the data. 
  - `jp-dic.training.xml' is the reconstructed evaluation data. Its
    size will be 26,818,377 bytes.
  - `art-train.txt' is the temporary file. Its size will be 10,808,264
    bytes.
  - `mai94.txt' is the file in the 1994 Mainiti Shimbun CD-ROM.
  - `text95_2' is the directory where four index files
    (mai.{idx,dif,ix1,ix2}) exist in the RWC CD-ROM.
  - `text95_3/ma94.udc' is the file in the RWC CD-ROM that consists of
    the ID number of the newspaper articles and UDC codes for those
    articles.
  - `text98_1/mai_ws.txt' consists of the sense IDs for the training
    data. This file is available at the following URL:

	http://www.rwcp.or.jp/wswg/rwcdb/text/text98_1.tar.gz
