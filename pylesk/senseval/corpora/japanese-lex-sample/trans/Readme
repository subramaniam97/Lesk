Data Set of SENSEVAL2 Japanese Task (translation task)

* Notice

This package contains the evaluation data and translation memory for
the translation task.

For evaluation data, we use text excerpts from 1994 Mainiti Shimbun
newspaper articles. Due to copyright restrictions, you are required to 
purchase the `1994 Mainiti Shimbun' CD-ROM and individually
reconstruct the evaluation data using tools provided in this
package. Purchase details for the Mainiti Shimbun CD-ROM can be viewed 
at: 

  http://cactus.aist-nara.ac.jp/lab/resource/cdrom/Mainichi/MS.html
  (written in Japanese only)

Alternatively, e-mail Kiyoaki Shirai at kshirai@jaist.ac.jp for details.

Morphological information and the categorical codes (Universal Decimal
Classification codes, UDC codes) for newspaper articles in the
evaluation data have been developed by RWCP (Real World Computing
Partnership). You also need the `RWC text database ver. 2' CD-ROM. You
can obtain it for a small charge. Purchase details for RWC text
database CD-ROM can be viewed at:

  http://www.rwcp.or.jp/wswg/rwcdb/text/index.html
  (written in Japanese only)

Note that the character coding system used in the data set is EUC, and
the character at the end of each line is LF (Line Feed).


* Permitted Uses

- The data in this package may only be used for research purpose.
- When you purchase 1994 Mainiti Shimbun CD-ROM, you may sign the
  copyright agreement form for Mainiti newspapers. If you violate the
  copyright restriction to use the CD-ROM, you lose the right to use
  the data in this package too, and should remove it from your
  organization immediately.

* Data for Translation Task

1. Evaluation Data

You must reconstruct the evaluation data from
`jp-trans.evaluation.xml.in' (see below).
See also `jp-lexical-sample.dtd' for details of tags and attributes
used in the evaluation data.

2. Translation Memory

`jp-tm.xml' is the translation memory. See also `jp-tm.dtd' for
details of tags and attributes used in the file.


* Data Reconstruction

1. To reconstruct the evaluation data:

cd test/
perl recon-art.pl -e -D text97_1/ma94 -I mai -F mai94.txt > art-eval.txt
perl recon-eval.pl -D jp-trans.evaluation.xml.in -I eval.idx -a art-eval.txt -u text95_3/ma94.udc > jp-trans.evaluation.xml

Note:
  - 1994 Mainiti Shimbun CD-ROM and RWC CD-ROM are required to
    reconstruct the data. 
  - `jp-trans.evaluation.xml' is the reconstructed evaluation
    data. Its size will be 13,879,585 bytes.
  - `art-eval.txt' is the temporary file. Its size will be 10,480,584
    bytes.
  - `mai94.txt' is the file in the 1994 Mainiti Shimbun CD-ROM.
  - `text97_1/ma94' is the directory where four index files
    (mai.{idx,dif,ix1,ix2}) exist in the RWC CD-ROM.
  - `text95_3/ma94.udc' is the file in the RWC CD-ROM that consists of
    the ID number of the newspaper articles and UDC codes for those
    articles.

2. To reconstruct the evaluation data without morphological information:

cd test/
perl recon-eval.pl -D jp-trans.evaluation.xml.in -I eval.idx -A mai94.txt > jp-trans.evaluation2.xml

Note:
  - 1994 Mainiti Shimbun CD-ROM is required to reconstruct the data.
    In this case, no morphological information and UDC codes for
    newspaper articles will be reconstructed.
  - `jp-trans.evaluation2.xml' is the reconstructed evaluation
    data. Its size will be 1,897,191 bytes.
  - `mai94.txt' is the file in the 1994 Mainiti Shimbun CD-ROM.
